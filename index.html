                <h1> Indian Monastic And Philosopher</h1> 
                <p>At the same time, vehement in his desire to know the truth about God, he questioned people of holy
                    reputation, asking them if they had seen God. He found such a person in Sri Ramakrishna, who became
                    his master, allayed his doubts, guided him on the spiritual path, and transformed him into sage and
                    prophet with authority to teach.

                    After Sri Ramakrishna's passing in 1886, Vivekananda renounced the world and crisscrossed India as a
                    wandering monk. His mounting compassion for India's people drove him to seek material help from the
                    West. Accepting an <b>opportunity to represent Hinduism at Chicago's Parliament of Religions in 1893,</b>
                    Vivekananda won instant celebrity in America and a ready forum for his spiritual teaching.
